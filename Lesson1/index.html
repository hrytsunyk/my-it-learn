            sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also serves as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie. Homer
            Simpson is 39 years old.

            <b>Bartholomew "Bart" Jojo Simpson</b> (born April 1[7] or February 23[8]) is the mischievous, rebellious,
            misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He
            is the only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been
            nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous
            comics, such as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a
            100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt
            Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.

            Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series[9],
            he has discovered a new comet which was named after him[10], and he also has performed in a successful band
            with Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.[11]

            <b>Lisa Marie Simpson</b> (born May 9)[9] is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and
            one of
            the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.


            In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train
            called Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the
            standard achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also
            the moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which
            leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in
            advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever,
            which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and
            at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of parental involvement
            also leads to her lashing out to those who she deems lower than her or even above her. She has extreme
            jealously from time to time and will do whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if
            she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things through.
