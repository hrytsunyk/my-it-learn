            many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about and,
            sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also serves as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie.
            Homer
            Simpson is 39 years old.

            rebellious,
            misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The
            Simpsons. He

            nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on
            numerous
            comics, such as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a
